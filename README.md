# SerasiApp

SerasiApp is a fun and simple matchmaking app built using Streamlit. The name 'Serasi' is derived from the Malay language, which means compatibility.

## Description

The app offers a game that allows users to input two names and determine their compatibility. The underlying algorithm is straightforward, starting with the calculation of the frequency of each letter in both names. These frequencies are then added in pairs, starting with the first and last frequencies, the second and second-to-last, and so on until only two indexes remain in the list. These two indexes are then combined to produce the final percentage score for the match.

With Streamlit's powerful capabilities, the app is dynamic and responsive, providing an engaging and user-friendly experience. Whether you're looking for a quick distraction or a fun way to spend a few minutes during a break, Serasi is the perfect app to test your compatibility with others.

## Usage

To use the app, simply input two names and hit the 'Calculate' button. The app will then provide you with a final percentage score for the match.

I would love to hear your thoughts on the app and how it can be improved. Please give it a try and let me know what you think. Your feedback is invaluable, and I appreciate your time and effort in testing the app.

Thank you for your interest in Serasi!
